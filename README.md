This is the Repository for the Python code for the Air Quality Prediction ANN. The goal of this project is to predict the air quality using weather data such as temperature and precipitation.

Two types of predictions are featured in the project: short-term and long-term. Short-term prediction only predicts the air quality for the next day, while long-term prediction predicts up to 5 days into the future. 

The primary code functionalities are:
1. AirQualityModel_LongTermPrediction - Long-term air quality prediction.
2. AirQualityModel_ShortTermPrediction - Short-term air quality prediction.
3. Data_Analysis - Analyze the datasets for correlation values between input and output variables as well as histograms of the output category frequency. 
4. Data_Prep-WithMonths-ALL - Prepares the datasets with weather data and air quality data.
